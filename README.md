# DNA Sequence Trie Search

## Overview

The DNA Sequence Trie Search is a C++ application that allows users to search for DNA sequences using a Trie data structure. It enables users to insert sequences from a pre-loaded FASTA file and search for exact or approximate matches with up to 2 mismatches.

Qt: IT IS USED FOR DESIGNING THE UI OF APPLICATION

## Features

- Insert DNA sequences from a FASTA file.
- Search for exact matches or approximate matches (with up to 2 mismatches).
- User-friendly Graphical User interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Qt 6.7.3 (or compatible version)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (optional, if you're using it)
